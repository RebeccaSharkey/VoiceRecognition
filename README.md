# Voice Recognition

## Collab Project Created in Unity

### This game was created to help users overcome Public Speaking with the aim for the project to be easily converted into a VR experience so that users could practice speaking infront of various audiences.

For this project I was one of the two programmers and I tasked myself with the job of creating the voice recognition mechanics for the entire game. After sometime learning and working with Windows inbuilt speech features I was able to convert these over into the Unity project and add keyword and phrase recognition to check whether or not users where able to make conversation and monologues that flowed while implementing certain buzz words. Not only this but because of how windows speech is set up it required users within this game to speak coherently for the words to be picked up. If a user knows they have said a word but it didn't get picked up by the system it prompts them to speak louder or to slow down to better improve their public speaking.
